# Vinted - Rest API project

A project learning from [Le Reacteur](https://github.com/lereacteur) to rebuid the backend using REST API for Vinted, a website where we can buy, sell, or trade clothes, shoes and accessories !

To keep "learning by doing" I also build some new route for user in order for them to update profile, and even delete the account.
